= Containerized development environment

ARSnova is a microservice-based system which usually would not be easy to setup for development.
To simplify the setup, `pdk` is available, a script which generates a Docker Compose configuration based on templates.
Furthermore, `pdk` is used to manage the containerized services.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

* CPU: 6 Cores or vCPU
* RAM: 16 GiB
* Storage: 10 GiB for Docker images and containers, additional storage for volumes containing user data depends on usage

=== Software

* Linux (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server for availability of official Docker packages)
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine] >= 20.10 (older versions might work but are not tested for compatibility)
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/[Docker Compose] >= 2.0
* Visual Studio Code

== Usage

=== Preparations

. Clone this repository.
. Switch to the repositoryâ€™s root directory and run `./pdk update`.
. Run `./pdk` to list all available commands.

=== Using the environment

To work with the development environment you first need to start it:

 ./pdk run -d

This starts all service containers.
On the first run, it will create Devcontainer images for the services of this repository.

The images use the prebuilt versions of the application from a base image.
This allows way, you have a completely functional system without building services which you are not working on.
The version of the base image for each service can be changed:

 ./pdk tags

For development, the prebuilt service needs to replaced with a development server.
When you open the subproject in Visual Studio Code (`./pdk open <project>`), the prebuild service is stopped automatically.
You can then launch the application from VS Code.

If you prefer to use another IDE, you can launch a development server independently from VS Code:

 ./pdk dev-server <project>

This also stops the prebuild service and runs the `bootRun` Gradle task for Spring projects.
Non-Spring-based projects are currently not supported by the `dev-server` command.


=== Commands

The `pdk` script supports the following commands:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|`run`
|Start Devcontainers for all services.

|`dev-server`
|Starts a development server.

|`open <project>`
|Open project in Devcontainer with Visual Studio Code.

|`tags`
|Set the image tags of projects to use with Docker Compose.

|`logs`
|Show logs or the log for a specific service.

|`compose`
|Execute a Docker Compose command.

|`update`
|Update Git repositories, Docker Compose configuration, Devcontainers and the Gradle dependency cache.

|`update-config`
|Update the configuration for Docker Compose. This command is automatically run when needed.

|`build`
|(Re-)build Devcontainers. This command is automatically run when needed.
|===

=== Known issues

* No prebuilt version of the webclient is launched when running `./pdk run`.
  It currently needs to be launched from VS Code.
* At this time, there is no mature VS Code plugin for Kotlin support.
  The plugin currently used for the devcontainers of Kotlin-based services has grave performance issues.
  Therefore, the use of another IDE is recommended for Kotlin development.
  A development server can be started with the `dev-server` command.
