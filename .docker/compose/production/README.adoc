= Docker orchestration for production

This directory contains files to integrate all of the Particify services and service dependencies using Docker:

* Configuration templates for Docker Compose
* `particifyctl`: A helper script to setup ARSnova using Docker Compose

These files are available separately for https://github.com/particify/arsnova-server/releases[releases],
so you do not need to clone the whole repository on production systems.

== Requirements

=== Hardware

* CPU: 4 Cores or vCPU
* RAM: 8 GiB
* Storage: 10 GiB for Docker images and containers, additional storage for volumes containing user data depends on usage

=== Software

* Linux (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server for availability of official Docker packages)
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine] >= 20.10 (older versions might work but are not tested for compatibility)
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/[Docker Compose] >= 2.0

== Usage

=== Preparations

. link:https://github.com/particify/arsnova-server/releases[Download the latest release].
. Extract the archive and switch to the extracted directory.
. Run `./particifyctl` to list all available commands.

=== Running

. Run `./particifyctl run`. Append `-d` to run in detached mode for production.
. Run `./particifyctl compose down` stop and remove the containers.

=== Configuration

The default configuration can be adjusted via environment variables.
To persist the configuration, add those variable assignments to `local.env` (one assignment per line).

Example: `PORT=8100 ./particifyctl run`

If you need to override the default Docker Compose configuration, you can add your configuration in `local.compose.yaml`.
The local configuration has perference over other `\*.compose.yaml` configurations provided in this repository.
We recommend that you only use the `local.*` files to adjust the configuration, so you do not need to manually merge changes when updating.

=== PostgreSQL updates

When the PostgreSQL image was updated to a new major version, `pg_upgrade.sh` needs to be run to perform a database migration.
The script expects the service name, the old and the new PostgreSQL version as parameters.
There is no rollback support, so backups for PostgreSQL volumes should be created before running the script.
