## Interactive Documentation of the REST API with Springfox(Swagger)

[Springfox](http://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current/) automated JSON API documentation for API's built with Spring and 
supports both version 1.2 and version 2.0 of the [Swagger Specification](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#swagger-restful-api-documentation-specification).
In this case we use the versionn 2.0 of Swagger. 

In the [Swagger Annotation Overview](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations) the most frequently-used Annotions are listed and described.
