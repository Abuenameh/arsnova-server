= Core service

This service handles the core functionality of ARSnova which includes:

* user accounts including authentication and registration
* rooms
* room announcements
* question series including contents and answers
* live feedback

== Technology

This service is written in Java and uses the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] framework.
It uses AspectJ with compile-time weaving.
Therefore, the code needs to be compiled by `ajc` (this is handled by Gradle).
For persistence, Apache CouchDB is used.
RabbitMQ is used for inter-service communication.
