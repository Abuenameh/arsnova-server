= Gateway service

This service provides an HTTP-based API gateway.
In the most simple case, it just proxies requests to upstream services.
In more complex cases, it transforms requests and responses or interacts with multiple services and creates its own composed response.
Furthermore, authorization handling is delegated to the authz service.

== Technology

This service is written in Kotlin and uses the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] and
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/[Spring Cloud Gateway] frameworks.
